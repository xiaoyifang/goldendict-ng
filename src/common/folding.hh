/// symbol into one. This facilitates searching. Here we currently perform
/// full case folding (everything gets translated to lowercase, ligatures
/// and complex letters are decomposed), diacritics folding (all diacritic
/// marks get removed) and whitespace/punctuation marks removal. These
/// transforms are done according to the Unicode standard and/or drafts. The
/// exact algorithms, lists and types of folding performed might get changed
/// in the future -- in this case, the Version field will be bumped up.
