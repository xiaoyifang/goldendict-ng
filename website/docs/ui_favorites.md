Favorites is a hierarchical structure of folders and words in them. You could create folders manually via context menu.

By default, the ⭐ icon on the toolbar will indiciate if word is in top most level.

You can "activate" a folder via context menu. Then the ⭐ icon will indiciate if a word is in this folder and clicking the ⭐ icon will add/remove words to/from this folder.

A group can have a associated folder.
When switching groups, the associated folder will be automatically activated. For simple use cases, just use the name of an existing folder.
If a folder is nested, then use `/` as a separator, such as `english/food/spicy` or `spanish/greetings`.

The entries can be moved simply by dragging and dropping. The entries can be deleted via context menu or by pressing the "Delete" key.

## Import & Export

In addition to adding and removing items to/from the Favorites you can perform the following operations via context menu or the main menu:

* "Export" - Export the all favoriates to a plain text or XML file.
* "Import" - The current favorites will be **replaced** by the content of XML or plain text.

!!! info
    Currently, XML will perserve folder structure but plain text won't!
