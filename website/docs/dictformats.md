## Additional info

### Converting between formats

GoldenDict-ng does not provide any dictionary modification functionality.

To convert between formats, try tools like [pyglossary](https://github.com/ilius/pyglossary).

### Custom Dictionary Icon

Every local dictionary can have a custom icon.
Supported formats are PNG, JPEG, GIF, SVG, WebP, ICO and BMP.

For most dictionary formats, a dictionary's icon file should have the same basename as the main dictionary file and be placed beside the main dictionary file. For example:

```
.
├── My_best_dictionary.mdx <- the main dictionary file
└── My_best_dictionary.svg <- the icon
```

For XDXF, GD will prioritize to use `icon16.png`, `icon32.png` or `dict.bmp` in the dictionary folder as icon.

For Epwing, the icon file should be placed beside the `catalogs` file and have the same name as the parent folder that contains `catalogs` file.


### Stardict

Main file of Stardict dictionary (.dict) can be compressed by Dictzip program to reduce its size.

Additional dictionary resources (images, style sheets, etc.) placed in "res" folder also can be compressed into zip archive. This archive must be named "res.zip" and placed beside other dictionary files or inside "res" folder.

### ABBYY Lingvo (.dsl)

Main file of ABBYY Lingvo dictionary (.dsl) can be compressed by Dictzip program to reduce its size.

Additional dictionary resources (images, sound files, etc.) also can be compressed into zip archive. This archive must be named on main dictionary file name (include extension) with adding ".files.zip" and placed beside other dictionary files. If main file of your dictionary, for example, named "My_best_dictionary.dsl" therefore archive with resources must be named "My_best_dictionary.dsl.files.zip".

GoldenDict supports the "#SOUND_DICTIONARY" directive. Sounds missing in the resources of the dictionary will be searched first in the dictionary specified in this directive.

### DictD and XDXF compression

Main file of DictD dictionary (.dict) or XDXF dictionary (.xdxf) can be compressed into `*.dict.dz` or `*.xdxf.dz` by Dictzip program to reduce its size.

### Slob

GoldenDict can render TeX formulas when a slob dictionary bundles MathJax.

### GLS

Main file of Babylon source dictionary must be in UTF-8 (or UTF-16 with BOM) encoding. It can be compressed by Dictzip program to reduce its size. Golden Dict read from dictionary header "### Glossary title:", "### Author:", "### Description:", "### Source language:" and "### Target language:" fields only. Dictionary header must be concluded with "### Glossary section:" mark.

### ABBYY Lingvo sound archives

ABBYY Lingvo sound archives are set of sound files packed into one file of some specific format. These files can be called directly from matches list or from dictionary articles.

### Sound files in separate folders

The separate folder with sound files can be added into GoldenDict dictionaries list. GoldenDict will handle this folders like ABBYY Lingvo sound archives (inapplicable in portable mode).

### Zips sound packs

Zips sound pack is zip archive with extension ".zips" contains set of sound files. To create suck pack it needs to compress sound files into zip archive and change extension of this archive to ".zips". GoldenDict will handle such sound packs like ABBYY Lingvo sound archives.

### General notes

At every launch GoldenDict scan folders with dictionaries to create dictionaries list. The more files in these folder is the more time for scanning. Therefore it is recommended to compress dictionary resources into zip archives and to use Zips sound packs instead of sound files in separate folders.
