### Wildcard matching

The search line can use wildcard or glob symbols for matching words.  

| Wildcard | Description                                                            | 
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `?`      | Matches any single character.                                          |
| `*`      | Matches zero or more of any characters.                                |
| `[abc]`  | Matches one character given in the bracket.                            |
| `[a-c]`  | Matches one character from the range given in the bracket.             |
| `[!abc]` | Matches one character that is not given in the bracket.                |
| `[!a-c]` | Matches one character that is not from the range given in the bracket. |
| `\`      | Escaping wildcard symbols, e.g. `\?` to search `?`                     |

!!! note
    The wildcard symbol in the first character leads to scanning of every dictionary's every word and may take a long time.

More information about wildcard matching can be found in [Wikipedia's glob article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)).
