# Portable mode

Typically, GoldenDict saves all program configurations and dictionary indexes in the user's home directory. In portable mode, these settings and indexes are stored in a separate folder called «portable» alongside the main program file. This mode is ideal for using GoldenDict with consistent settings directly from a USB drive on different computers.

To enable portable mode, you simply need to create a «portable» folder next to the main program file. Once this folder exists, GoldenDict will launch in portable mode.

In portable mode, GoldenDict operates with certain restrictions:

All dictionaries must be placed in the «content» folder alongside the main program file and/or its subfolders. 


folder structure:
```
goldendict.exe
portable/
content/
...
```
